# CAD-Project
The project was made in the third year of the B.sc Degree
In this project I build a fighting bot that is fit to participate in the heavy category of the Robot Wars competitions. The main fetcher is the 10 HP weapon and the Heavy defenses. The project was made by me with a help of a partner.
